## **ROUTE OPTIMIZATION PROJECT FOR CONTAINERIZED FREIGHT IN RIVERS STATE**
This project has its roots in **Shortest Path Problems** and aims to determine the least-cost path in travelling from an origin say ***A*** to any destination ***Z*** for trucks carrying containers, while passing through ***K***-number of intermediate nodes. Its scope is Rivers State, Nigeria, and will feature:

#### **1. A GRAPH:**
A graph of the entire Rivers State road networks as are relevant to movement of container-carrying trucks.
#### **2. NODES:**
The graph will also have layered on, stop points relevant to typical truck travel behaviour as nodes. Some of which include Port Harcourt Port, Onne Port, Bonded Warehouses, Maintenance and truck service points, and Petrol stations for refuelling.
#### **3. WEIGHTS:**
The variables to be optimized for are time, distance, fuel consumption and congestion. The Shortest Path computation will use a dual-mode cost function;
  - **Single-Cost Mode**: In this mode the user can optimize for any specific variable.
  - **Weighted-Cost Mode**: In this mode the user can optimize for the combination of all factors which utilizes costs as is useful in real life decision making and route planning.

    By integrating geospatial data, a multi-variable cost function and routing algorithms this projects provide a reliable framework, helping logistics managers, fleet managers and transport policy makers minimize costs and support efficient route planning.

    #### KEY FEATURES
    
- **GIS integration-** uses geospatial data to model real-world logistics networks.

- **Node-based modeling–** represents ports, terminals, depots, and warehouses as nodes.

- **Dynamic routing–** optimizes routes based on multiple factors (distance, cost, time, congestion).

- **Google Maps API and OSM data–** for accurate geolocation, mapping, and boundary data.

- **Data-driven and reliable insights–** generates route efficiency reports for logistics planning.

- **Scalable framework–** can be extended to other regions or logistics networks.
